# Task 10: Performance Optimization and Deployment

## Objective
Optimize the dashboard for performance and prepare it for deployment to ensure fast loading times and smooth user experience.

## Requirements
- Optimize asset loading and rendering
- Implement caching strategies
- Minimize initial page load time
- Ensure smooth interactions and animations
- Prepare for production deployment

## Implementation Steps
1. Perform performance audit:
   - Run Lighthouse/PageSpeed tests
   - Identify performance bottlenecks
   - Create optimization priority list
2. Implement asset optimizations:
   - Image compression and proper sizing
   - CSS and JavaScript minification
   - Font loading optimization
   - SVG optimization for team logos
3. Apply advanced performance techniques:
   - Code splitting and lazy loading
   - Critical CSS path optimization
   - Efficient caching strategies
   - Service worker implementation
4. Optimize data loading:
   - Implement pagination for large datasets
   - Use data streaming where appropriate
   - Add loading states and placeholders
5. Prepare deployment configuration:
   - Set up build process
   - Configure CDN integration
   - Implement environment-specific settings
   - Create deployment documentation
